Microsoft Lawsuit 2025: ACCC Action (October 27, 2025)
------------------------------------------------------

**Plaintiff:** Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)

**Defendants:** Microsoft Corporation (US) & Microsoft Pty Ltd (AU)

**Filed:** October 27, 2025, in the Federal Court of Australia

### Allegations

The ACCC alleges Microsoft misled ~2.7 million Australian auto-renewing subscribers of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans by:

*   Communicating they must either **accept Copilot integration at a higher price** or **cancel** their subscription.
*   **Concealing a third option**: the "Classic" plan, which offered the same core apps (Word, Excel, etc.) without Copilot at the **pre-increase price** ($109/year for Personal, $139/year for Family).
*   The "Classic" plan was only revealed _after_ a user began the cancellation process.

### Price Increases

*   **Microsoft 365 Personal:** $109 → $159/year (+45%)
*   **Microsoft 365 Family:** $139 → $179/year (+29%)

### ACCC's Claim

The ACCC argues this conduct was **false, misleading, and deceptive** under the Australian Consumer Law, as customers were denied a genuine choice. They allege Microsoft deliberately omitted the Classic plan to minimize opt-outs from the more expensive, AI-integrated plans.

### Relief Sought

The ACCC is seeking **penalties, injunctions, declarations, consumer redress, and costs**.
